•	What Web Application security mechanisms are involved in your topology? What security mechanisms would ideally be involved?

Some security mechanisms we have implemented in our topology are our database server that will be set to hash any passwords inputted so plaintext passwords are not saved. Ideally, a packet filter, antivirus, and a network intrusion detection and prevention system can help to enhance the security in our topology.

•	What testing framework did you choose and why?

We chose to use PyTest as our testing framework as we were all comfortable writing Python scripts and PyTest allows for easy and quick test script creation.

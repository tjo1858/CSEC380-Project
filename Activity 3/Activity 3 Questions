•	Provide a link to the test cases you generated for this activity.

•	How do you ensure that users that navigate to the protected pages cannot bypass authentication requirements?
  
  We ensure that users cannot navigate to protected pages by creating a new session everytime a user logins in. This limits other people
  from accessing pages that are locked behind our authentication. These session IDs are long and difficult to guess, making bypassing the 
  authentication requirements much more difficult.
  
•	How do you protect against session fixation?

  Session fixation can be protected against by generating a unique unpredictable session id for each user when the log in and
  making said session id expire as soon as they close the page / log out. 
  
•	How do you ensure that if your database gets stolen passwords aren’t exposed?

  We take a salted hash of the passwords using the Werkzeug library in Python in our database. We then hash the inputted password
  from the user and check the hash against the salted hash stored in the database. This prevents a user from using a hash as a password
  and prevents a user from having a plain text password if the SQL database was ever leaked.
  
•	How do you prevent password brute force?

•	How do you prevent username enumeration?

  Username enumeration can be prevented by not serving a specific message when a client enters an incorrect username and password.
  When a username is entered incorrectly, instead of responding with something like "incorrect username", respond with something like,
  "incorrect username and/or password." This will prevent enumeration of any usernames.

•	What happens if your sessionID is predictable, how do you prevent that?
  
  If the session ID was predictable, which ours is not as stated in a previous question, you could manually set the session ID to be a
  series of cryptographically secure random bytes. This would make the session ID less predictable and more secure, stopping session fixation.

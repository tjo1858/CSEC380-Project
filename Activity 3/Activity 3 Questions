•	Provide a link to the test cases you generated for this activity.
•	How do you ensure that users that navigate to the protected pages cannot bypass authentication requirements?
•	How do you protect against session fixation?
    Session fixation can be protected against by generating a unique unpredictable session id for each user when the log in and
    making said session id expire as soon as they close the page / log out. 
•	How do you ensure that if your database gets stolen passwords aren’t exposed?
•	How do you prevent password brute force?
•	How do you prevent username enumeration?
    Username enumeration can be prevented by not serving a specific message when a client enters an incorrect username and password.
    When a username is entered incorrectly, instead of responding with something like "incorrect username", respond with something like,
    "incorrect username and/or password." This will prevent enumeration of any usernames.
•	What happens if your sessionID is predictable, how do you prevent that?
